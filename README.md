# Webshop frontend project

## Description

Webshop frontend is a project that I'm making in order to learn Flutter AND Dart properly. I'm trying to figure out all the best practices there are in order to become more familiar with the technologies.

So far I know I will use Platzi Fake Store API as a webshop backend in order to focus 100 % on the frontend and making it look and feel good and professional enough.

There also will be authorization on the web page.

## Used APIs
